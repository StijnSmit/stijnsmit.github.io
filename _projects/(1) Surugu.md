# Surugu – A Puzzle App for iOS

Surugu is my minimalist, iOS-native puzzle app that brings a modern user experience to one of my favorite logic games: Suguru. Most apps in this genre are either behind a paywall or feel dated and cluttered. Surugu is my answer to that problem—a clean, free, and carefully crafted alternative.

Built entirely in **Swift with SwiftUI and SwiftData**, Surugu follows Apple’s latest Human Interface Guidelines and adapts seamlessly between light and dark mode. The UI includes smooth transitions and micro-animations that enhance the experience without getting in the way of focus.

Rather than relying on endless auto-generated puzzles, Surugu serves **fun, handpicked puzzles** through a backend, updated weekly. The goal is quality over quantity: every puzzle feels purposeful, not repetitive.

Other features include:
- An intuitive **undo system** (no penalty for experimenting)

- Weekly updates with new puzzles

- A distraction-free interface with zero ads, zero paywalls

Surugu is available now on the App Store
